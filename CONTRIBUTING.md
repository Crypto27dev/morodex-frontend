# Contributing to the Pancake ecosystem ðŸ¥ž

Thanks for taking the time to contribute !
You can start by reading our [Contribution guidelines](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/contributing) first.

## Setup

Install the dependencies

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

Don't forget to setup your IDE with `eslint` and `prettier`.

## Project structure

- **components** contains generic components used inside the application.
- **views** contains building blocks for each page. The entry point of a view is used as the root component of each route.
- **config** contains all the config files and ABIs.
- **state** contains the redux files for the global state of the app.
- **context** contains global contexts (separated from the redux store)
- **hooks** contains generic hooks.
- **utils** contains generic utilities functions.
- **pages** contains page components for next.js

## Tests

Run tests with `yarn test`.

## Issue reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

4. **Add attachments** &mdash; add photos or videos

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.
